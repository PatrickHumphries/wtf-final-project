From here on out we’ll have consistent days, consistent hours, and most important, a consistent menu item. TACOS. See below for some @elephantshack history. 👇\n—\nThis 1974 Chevy box truck was originally a California taco truck and moved to Michigan to become the first licensed food truck in the state. We’ve decided to take it back to its roots and will be serving up tacos five days a week. Follow us for daily menu updates. 📸: @hungryindetroit #easternmarketbrewingco"
